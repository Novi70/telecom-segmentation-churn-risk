Telecom Customer Segmentation with Churn Risk Insights



PROJECT OVERVIEW



Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, directly impacting revenue and customer lifetime value.

This project focuses on segmenting telecom customers and analyzing churn risk patterns to help businesses identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.



The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with customer segmentation techniques to derive meaningful business insights.





BUSINESS OBJECTIVES



Identify different customer segments based on usage and service behavior

Analyze churn patterns across customer groups

Highlight key factors influencing customer churn

Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies





DATASET



Telecom customer dataset containing:

 	Customer demographics

 	Service subscriptions

 	Usage metrics

 	Churn indicator





KEY ANALYSIS PERFORMED



Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer segmentation analysis

Churn distribution analysis across segments

Visualization of important trends and patterns





TOOLS \& TECHNOLOGIES



Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook





KEY INSIGHTS



Certain customer segments show significantly higher churn risk

Contract type and service usage patterns strongly influence churn

Long-term customers tend to have lower churn probability





FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS



Build a machine learning model to predict churn probability

Feature engineering for deeper behavioral insights

Deployment as an interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI)
